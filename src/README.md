# Grayscale-Image-Reconstruction-NNMF-SGD-SVD
Given a set of grayscale images with missing parts, reconstruct the images by approximating missing parts using non-negative matrix factorization, stocastic gradient descent SGD and singular value decomposition SVD. From scratch

I would sugger to go in the repertory test and to run the command "python3 testNMF.py" 
to have a clear idea of it is about
